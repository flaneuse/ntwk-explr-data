Once diapause has begun, metabolic activity is suppressed even if conditions favorable for development prevail. Once initiated, only certain stimuli are capable of releasing the organism from this state, and this characteristic is essential in distinguishing diapause from hibernation.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0055115	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FGO_0055115/hierarchicalParents

FBcv:0005079	integrase target site	A recognition site for an integrase, an enzyme that mediates an exchange reaction between two DNA templates, resulting in integration of DNA from one of the templates into the other. An integrase binds a pair of compatible recognition sites (typically called attP and attB) which each contain a short integration core flanked by imperfect inverted repeats that are not identical. Exchange between the attP/attB pair results in the formation of hybrid sites (typically called attL and attR) that are no longer a substrate of the integrase. Thus the exchange reaction driven by an integrase is undirectional. Mutually exclusive pairs of recognition site have been engineered for some integrases. Integrases can be used to generate many different types of genetic modification, with the outcome being influenced by the relative orientation (direct or inverted), relative location and composition of the two recognition sites. The types of possible modification include deletion of DNA, generation of chromosomal rearrangements, integration of DNA into the genome, and replacement of genetic material with that from a donor plasmid using integrase-mediated cassette exchange (IMCE).		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005079	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005079/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005078	RNA-guided nuclease	An enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of DNA in a site-specific manner, and in which the specificity is determined by a guide RNA that contains sequence complementary to the DNA sequence of interest, rather than being an inherent property of the nuclease itself.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005078	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005078/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005077	nuclease	An enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of DNA in a site-specific manner. The DNA cutting stimulates cellular repair mechanisms, which can be exploited to produce genome modifications. For example, repair by homologous recombination in the presence of an exogenous template can be used to introduce targeted changes into the genome.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005077	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005077/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005076	integrase	An enzyme that mediates an exchange reaction between two DNA templates, resulting in integration of DNA from one of the templates into the other. An integrase binds a pair of compatible recognition sites (typically called attP and attB) which each contain a short integration core flanked by imperfect inverted repeats that are not identical. Exchange between the attP/attB pair results in the formation of hybrid sites (typically called attL and attR) that are no longer a substrate of the integrase. Thus the exchange reaction driven by an integrase is undirectional. Mutually exclusive pairs of recognition site have been engineered for some integrases. Integrases can be used to generate many different types of genetic modification, with the outcome being influenced by the relative orientation (direct or inverted), relative location and composition of the two recognition sites.

FBcv:0005074	misexpression element	The basic components of a misexpression element are an enhancer sequence plus a minimal promoter. Upon integration into the genome, this element can activate expression of nearby endogenous loci. Typically, constructs containing misexpression elements are designed to insert at or near the 5' end of a gene, such that expression from the promoter within the misexpression element drives overexpression of the endogenous locus and causes a gain-of-function phenotype. However, if the insertion is within a locus, a truncated product may be produced, while an insertion in the opposite orientation to that of the direction of transcription of the endogenous locus can result in the production of an antisense transcript. If the enhancer present in the misexpression element forms part of a binary expression system, the misexpression pattern of the endogenous gene is controlled by combining the misexpression element insertion with a driver expressed in the desired temporal and spatial pattern.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005074	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005074/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005068	insertional mutagenesis tool	Sequence that forms all or part of a transgenic locus or modified endogenous locus and which is designed to impact or assess any proximate gene(s) when integrated into the genome.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005068	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005068/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005073	promoter trap	The basic component of a promoter trap cassette is a promoterless gene. This gene is not flanked by splice acceptor or donor sites, and thus the gene within a promoter trap can only be expressed if the cassette integrates into the genome within an exon, resulting in a transcriptional fusion. If the promoter trap gene encodes an open reading frame and the insertion is in the correct frame, a translational fusion is produced. Depending on the nature of the gene encoded by the promoter trap cassette, the insertion may directly report the expression pattern of the 'trapped' locus (e.g. if the gene encoded by the cassette is a reporter enzyme or fluorescent protein), or it may be used to drive expression of any gene of interest (e.g. if the gene encoded by the cassette is a driver that form part of a binary expression system). A promoter trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic construct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR. Promoter trap insertions are usually mutagenic, disrupting the locus into which they have inserted, since termination sequences are usually present at the 3' end of the cassette, truncating the endogenous transcript.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005073	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005073/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005072	polyA trap	The basic components of a polyA trap cassette are a promoter fused to a gene sequence that lacks a polyadenylation (polyA) sequence but is followed by a splice donor sequence. If the cassette is integrated into the genome outside a gene, the mRNA produced by the polyA trap is not polyadenylated and is expected to be rapidly degraded. However, if the cassette is integrated into an intron, the promoter in the polyA trap will drive expression of a transcriptional fusion containing the polyA gene trap fused to any downstream exons. The downstream terminal exon can provide a polyA signal, allowing stable expression of the gene encoded by the polyA trap. polyA trap cassettes can be used to report the expression of genes that are not normally expressed, or are expressed at very low levels, or may be used as a marker of successful integration of an insertion into a transcription unit. A polyA trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic contruct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005072	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005072/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005071	gene trap	A gene trap cassette is designed to interrupt transcription of an endogenous locus upon integration of the cassette into the genome. The basic components of a gene trap cassette are a promoterless gene with an upstream splice acceptor site. Upon integration into an intron, splicing from the genomic splice donor site to the splice acceptor site in the cassette results in a transcriptional fusion containing the endogenous exon(s) upstream of the insertion fused to the gene sequence encoded by the cassette. Any open reading frame (ORF) encoded by the trap cassette gene may be translated from this transcriptional fusion either as a translational fusion with any ORF sequence encoded by the upstream exons, or if an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or viral 2A-like peptide sequence (which promotes ribosome skipping) is present upstream of the gene trap ORF, it may be produced as a separate protein expressed under the control of the regulatory sequences of the endogenous locus. Gene trap insertions are usually mutagenic, disrupting the locus into which they have inserted, since termination sequences are usually present at the 3' end of the cassette, truncating the endogenous transcript. Depending on the nature of the gene encoded by the gene trap cassette, a gene trap insertion may directly report the expression pattern of the disrupted locus (e.g. if it encodes a reporter enzyme or fluorescent protein), or it may be used to drive expression of any gene of interest in the pattern of the trapped locus (e.g. if it is a driver that forms part of a binary expression system). A gene trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic contruct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005071	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005071/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005070	protein trap	A protein trap cassette is designed to tag protein(s) encoded by an endogenous locus upon integration of the cassette into the genome. The basic structure of a protein trap cassette is an artificial exon composed of a splice acceptor site, an open reading frame without initiation and stop codons, and a splice donor site. No promoter sequences are present. Upon integration into a coding intron of an endogenous locus, the open reading frame (ORF) encoded by the artificial exon can be incorporated into ('tag') the protein encoded by the locus. This only occurs if the insertion is in the correct orientation and when the frame of the artificial exon corresponds to that of the preceeding exon. Thus, only one out of six insertions in a coding intron will function as a protein trap. To account for each reading frame, three versions of a given protein trap element, differing only in the splice phase, are typically produced for use in an insertional mutagenesis screen. Depending on the nature of the ORF encoded by the artificial exon, the tag may be used to detect the expression pattern and/or subcellular localization of the protein (e.g. if the tag is an epitope tag or fluorescent protein), to drive expression of a gene of interest (e.g. if the tag is a driver that forms part of a binary expression system), or may modify the properties of the endogenous protein (e.g. if the tag affects protein localization or stability). A protein trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic construct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR. The presence of the splice acceptor and donor sites mean that a protein trap cassette is not inherently mutagenic, since it is designed to insert in frame into a protein. However, an insertion into an intron that splits a critical functional or localization domain may alter the activity of the encoded protein, and the protein trap tag sequence itself may be designed to alter function (for example targeting the protein to a new location within the cell or altering its stability).		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005070	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005070/hierarchicalParents
FBcv:0005069	enhancer trap	An enhancer trap cassette is designed to report or utilize the expression of endogenous enhancer elements upon integration of the cassette into the genome. The basic components of an enhancer trap cassette are a minimal promoter element fused upstream of a gene. Upon integration into the genome, a neighboring genomic enhancer may activate expression of the gene encoded by the enhancer trap cassette. Depending on the nature of this gene, the insertion may directly report the expression pattern of the 'trapped' enhancer (e.g. if the gene encodes a reporter enzyme or fluorescent protein), or it may be used to drive expression of any gene of interest (e.g. if the gene encodes a driver that forms part of a binary expression system). An enhancer trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic contruct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR. An enhancer trap insertion can be mutgenic, disrupting the function of an endogenous locus, depending on the particular insertion site.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005069	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0005069/hierarchicalParents

A binary expression system requires a transactivator ('driver') that binds to a specific DNA sequence ('regulatory region' or 'effector'). A driver encoded by one transgenic locus or modified endogenous locus is used to drive expression of a downstream 'responder' or 'reporter' encoded by another transgenic locus or modified endogenous locus, by fusing the regulatory region sequence to which the driver binds upstream of the responder sequence.

However, recognition sites can be mutated to drive the directionality of the reaction: different classes of site may be combined so that recombination can occur in one direction, but produces reformed sites that are no longer compatible. In addition, mutually exclusive sites have been engineered for some recombinases. Recombinases can be used to generate many different types of genetic modification, with the outcome being influenced by the relative orientation (direct or inverted), relative location and composition of the two recognition sites.

GO:0050975	sensory perception of touch	The series of events required for an organism to receive a touch stimulus, convert it to a molecular signal, and recognize and characterize the signal. This is a neurological process. The perception of touch in animals is mediated by mechanoreceptors in the skin and mucous membranes and is the sense by which contact with objects gives evidence as to certain of their qualities. Different types of touch can be perceived (for example, light, coarse, pressure and tickling) and the stimulus may be external or internal (e.g. the feeling of a full stomach).	perception of touch	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0050975	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FGO_0050975/hierarchicalParents

FBcv:0000292	antimorphic allele - genetic evidence	An allele that is inferred to make a gene product that is antagonistic to the wild-type gene product from the observations that extra copies of the wild-type allele reduce the expressivity and/or penetrance of the phenotype. So, the phenotype over a deficiency is stronger than that over a wild-type allele, which in turn is stronger than that in the presence of a duplication of the wild-type locus. This test is similar to that used for hypomorphic alleles. An antimorph can be distinguished from a dominant hypermorph as only the former can be reverted to wild-type by deletion of the mutant allele.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0000292	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0000292/hierarchicalParents

GO:0006887	exocytosis	A process of secretion by a cell that results in the release of intracellular molecules (e.g. hormones, matrix proteins) contained within a membrane-bounded vesicle. Exocytosis can occur either by full fusion, when the vesicle collapses into the plasma membrane, or by a kiss-and-run mechanism that involves the formation of a transient contact, a pore, between a granule (for exemple of chromaffin cells) and the plasma membrane. The latter process most of the time leads to only partial secretion of the granule content. Exocytosis begins with steps that prepare vesicles for fusion with the membrane (tethering and docking) and ends when molecules are secreted from the cell.	vesicle exocytosis	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0006887	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FGO_0006887/hierarchicalParents

FBcv:0003009	TALEN	Sequence change caused by the cleavage of specific DNA sequences by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). TALEN proteins comprise a DNA binding domain fused to the catalytic domain of the FokI endonuclease. The DNA binding domain contains a repetitive region within the middle of the protein, consisting of tandem repeats of 34 amino acid segments, with each of these segments recognizing a single base pair. The specificity of the binding is determined by two hypervariable amino acids in positions 12 and 13 (repeat-variable diresidues). Cleavage requires dimerization of FokI. The endonuclease is directed to a target region by a pair of TALENs which bind to adjacent sequences separated by a spacer region, allowing dimerization and promoting cleavage.	change induced by TALE endonuclease cleavage	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0003009	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FFBcv_0003009/hierarchicalParents

GO:0019953	sexual reproduction	A reproduction process that creates a new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms. It occurs both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes: in multicellular eukaryotic organisms, an individual is created anew; in prokaryotes, the initial cell has additional or transformed genetic material. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) originating from two different individuals (parents) join up so that homologous sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. After the new recombinant chromosome is formed, it is passed on to progeny.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0019953	False	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/api/ontologies/fbcv/terms/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FGO_0019953/hierarchicalParents
